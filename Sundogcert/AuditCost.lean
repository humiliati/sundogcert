  Audit-asymmetry certificate  (Lean 4 / mathlib v4.30.0) — HS7, prereg frozen at `37d3306`.

  ONE FINITE SETTING.  Populations are `u : Fin n → ℚ`; the observation channel is the pair
  `(report, pooledMean u)`; empirical statistics are finite sums.  No `Measure ℝ` anywhere — the
  audit half and the blindness half live on literally the same interface (the banked ShadowDecay
  tower states its determine/resist law in `Measure ℝ`; this module is its finite, certificate-
  grade sibling, not a restatement).

  WHAT IS PROVED.
    (i)  An audit game sound against an ADVERSARIAL REPORTER: over reporter strategies
         `σ : (Fin n → ℚ) → ℚ`, no false report accepts (`audit_sound`, `dishonest_caught`) and
         the honest report always accepts (`audit_complete`, `honest_accepts`) — with a faithful
         per-audit op-count `auditCost n ≤ 3·n + 2` (`auditCost_le`), exact value `2n + 1`
         (`auditCost_eq`), in the CheckCost.lean trust-surface style.
    (ii) CHANNEL-LEVEL BLINDNESS QUANTIFIED OVER ALL VERIFIERS (`pooled_channel_blind`): for EVERY
         decidable `A : ℚ × ℚ → Bool` seeing only `(report, pooledMean u)`, every coordinate `i`,
         and every prescribed `δ`, an EXPLICIT fiber pair (`bump`) has equal pooled mean, per-unit
         difference exactly `δ`, and identical verdicts for every report.  Impossibility form
         (`no_verifier_checks_perUnit`): no channel verifier is sound-and-complete for ANY
         per-unit claim `u i = v`.
    (iii) NON-VACUITY: at `n = 1` the channel DETERMINES the unit (`n1_channel_determines`) — the
         blindness genuinely needs `n ≥ 2`; and the same fiber pair every channel verifier misses
         is SEPARATED by the second-moment statistic (`secondMoment_separates`) — the hidden
         information sits one statistic above the mean; it is the channel that is blind, not the
         pair that is identical.
    HEADLINE (`audit_asymmetry`): full per-unit access decides every report at linear cost, while
    every pooled-channel verifier is per-unit blind — one statement, one setting.

  TRUST SURFACE (audited by a human, exactly as in CheckCost.lean).  The COST MODEL: the audit's
  dominant path folds the `n` per-unit values into the running sum (`n` term-reads counted by
  `sumReadCost`, `n − 1` additions), then one division by `n`, one equality test against the
  report.  Nothing forces this correspondence mechanically — it is asserted, then audited.  Given
  the audited model, `auditCost_le` is a THEOREM (kernel-checked, axiom-clean, no `native_decide`).

  HONEST SCOPE.
    • The blindness certifies the POOLED OBSERVABLE.  A reporter that itself has per-unit access
      can still encode per-unit facts in the report; the theorem says no verifier can CHECK such a
      claim against the pooled observable (`no_verifier_checks_perUnit`) — not that reports carry
      no information.
    • A finite rational-mean channel — the certified template for audit-asymmetry claims; NOT a
      claim about trained systems, and NOT "introspection".
    • The blindness PROOF is short: data processing is short (verdict equality is congruence from
      pooled-mean equality).  The content is the STATEMENT — what is quantified over (`∀` verifier)
      and what is constructed (the prescribed-δ fiber pair) — adjudicated by the prereg's K2
      structure audit against the banked-statement list.

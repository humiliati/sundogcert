  Sundogcert/DecodingNPHard.lean — the DEDUCTIVE CORE of NP-hardness of SYNDROME DECODING
  over GF(2), via the reduction from EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS (EC3S / X3C).
  (Lean 4 / mathlib v4.30.0.  Berlekamp–McEliece–van Tilborg route.)

  WHAT THIS FILE PROVES (the deductive core — MILESTONES 1 AND 2 BOTH DONE):
    * the reduction is laid out exactly as designed: an EC3S instance `(c : Fin s → Finset X)`
      becomes a parity-check matrix `Hmat c` over `ZMod 2` with target syndrome `allOnes`, and a
      bounded-weight decoding question `Decodes c q`.
    * the KEY CONNECTION (`connection`): for the indicator error `eOf T`, the syndrome
      `Hmat c *ᵥ eOf T` is the mod-2 cast of the cover count — so "syndrome = allOnes" is exactly
      "every point is covered an ODD number of times".  An exact cover (count = 1) is odd.
    * the DOUBLE-COUNT (`incidence_double_count`): `∑ i∈T, (c i).card = ∑ x, coverCount c T x`,
      which with `hc` (each 3-set has card 3) and `hX` (|X| = 3q) pins `T.card = q`.
    * `reduction_forward` (PROVED): an exact cover yields a weight-`≤ q` decoding witness.
    * `reduction_backward` (PROVED, MILESTONE 2): a weight-`≤ q` decoding witness MUST be a 0/1
      exact-cover indicator.  Over `ZMod 2` the error is 0/1, so its support `T` has `eOf T = e`
      and `|T| ≤ q`; "syndrome = allOnes" forces every cover count ODD hence `≥ 1`, and the
      double-count `∑ coverCount = 3|T| ≥ |X| = 3q` pins `|T| = q`; equal sums with the pointwise
      `≥ 1` bound force every cover count `= 1` — an exact cover.
    * `reduction_iff` (UNCONDITIONAL): the full `X3C c ↔ Decodes c q`, both directions now
      machine-checked (`⟨reduction_forward, reduction_backward⟩`) — NO hypothesis, NO `sorry`,
      NO `axiom`.  The reduction's correctness is FULLY proved; only the COMPLEXITY WRAPPING
      remains the named imported wall (below).

  WIRE-IN TO THE CERTIFICATE.  `Decodes c q` is EXACTLY the decision form of
  `Sundog.Certificate.CertWall.minCosetWeight (Hmat c) allOnes ≤ q` — we use the EXISTENTIAL
  form (∃ e, Hmat *ᵥ e = allOnes ∧ hammingNorm e ≤ q) rather than `minCosetWeight ≤ q` to dodge
  the `sInf`-of-empty-coset pitfall (`safe_iff_minCosetWeight_le` in CertWall is the bridge when
  the coset is nonempty).  So this reduction LANDS on the certificate's imported hardness wall:
  CertWall's `minCosetWeight` is the very quantity an EC3S→decoding reduction makes NP-hard.

  THE IMPORTED WALL (named, NOT proved — mathlib has no complexity framework):
    * the NP complexity class itself;
    * poly-time-ness of this reduction (it is visibly local, but "polynomial" is unformalized);
    * EC3S's own NP-hardness (Karp 1972).
  STANDING LIMIT.  With milestone 2 done, this proves "decoding is NP-hard CONDITIONAL on P≠NP" —
  hardness is never absolute, and this limit is UNCHANGED by completing the backward direction.
  What IS proved (now in full) is that bounded-weight GF(2) decoding is exactly as hard as a
  canonical NP-hard problem (EC3S): the reduction correctness `X3C c ↔ Decodes c q` is fully
  machine-checked; only the complexity wrapping above stays imported.

  CORRECTNESS NOTE (a wrong reduction is the failure mode).  Decoding is over GF(2), so
  `H *ᵥ e` is a MOD-2 (XOR) sum.  EC3S is the right source problem because GF(2) is the natural
  operation for COVERING (odd-cover) — unlike subset-sum, which needs integer carries and is WRONG
  over GF(2).  The connection lemma makes the odd-cover ⇔ syndrome=allOnes equivalence explicit.

/-! ### THE THEOREMS. -/

/-- **FORWARD (PROVED).**  An EC3S exact cover yields a bounded-weight GF(2) decoding witness:
    the column-selection `eOf T` has syndrome `allOnes` (connection lemma) and weight
    `T.card = q ≤ q` (double-count). -/

  rw [hammingNorm_eOf, exactCover_card_eq c q hc hX T hT]

/-- **BACKWARD (PROVED, MILESTONE 2).**  A bounded-weight GF(2) decoding witness MUST be a 0/1
    exact-cover indicator.  Over `ZMod 2` every coordinate of `e` is `0` or `1`, so for its support
    `T := {i | e i ≠ 0}` we have `e = eOf T` and `|T| = hammingNorm e ≤ q`.  "Syndrome = allOnes"
    casts each cover count to `1` in `ZMod 2`, forcing it ODD hence `≥ 1`; the double-count plus
    `hc` gives `∑ coverCount = 3|T|`, and pointwise `≥ 1` summed gives `∑ coverCount ≥ |X| = 3q`,
    pinning `|T| = q`.  Finally equal sums against the pointwise `≥ 1` bound force every cover count
    to be EXACTLY `1` — an exact cover. -/

  Sundogcert/MatchingNPHard.lean — the KARP-LAYER EXTENSION of the formalized hardness chain:
  3-DIMENSIONAL MATCHING (3DM) reduces to EXACT-COVER-BY-3-SETS (X3C), composed through
  frontier #1's `reduction_iff` into bounded-weight GF(2) decoding.  (Lean 4 / mathlib v4.30.0.)

  WHAT THIS FILE PROVES (pure combinatorics — the reduction CORRECTNESS, no gadgets):
    * `ThreeDM t` — a perfect 3-dimensional matching among the `s` triples `t : Fin s → W×X×Y`:
      a selection `T` of triples covering each W-, X-, and Y-element exactly once.
    * `reduce3DM t` — the Karp reduction: each triple `(w,x,y)` becomes its 3-element set
      `{inl w, inr (inl x), inr (inr y)}` in the X3C universe `W ⊕ X ⊕ Y`.
    * `threeDM_iff_X3C` (THE HEADLINE) — `ThreeDM t ↔ X3C (reduce3DM t)`, machine-checked.  Both
      sides are `∃ T, <cond>`; the X3C exact-cover condition over `W ⊕ X ⊕ Y` decomposes (via
      `Sum.forall`, twice) into exactly the three per-part "covered once" conditions of `ThreeDM`.
      No gadgets — the equivalence is the Sum-universe bookkeeping, nothing more.
    * `reduce3DM_card` — every reduce-set is a genuine 3-set (the three Sum-tagged elements are
      pairwise distinct: `inl ≠ inr`, and the two `inr`-branches differ by `inl ≠ inr` again).
    * `reduce3DM_univ_card` — with `|W| = |X| = |Y| = q`, the universe `W ⊕ X ⊕ Y` has `3q` points.
    * `threeDM_iff_Decodes` (THE COMPOSITION / PAYOFF) — chaining the headline through frontier #1's
      PROVED `reduction_iff` (whose hypotheses `(c i).card = 3` and `|universe| = 3q` are discharged
      by the two card lemmas) yields `ThreeDM t ↔ Decodes (reduce3DM t) q`.  The hardness chain
      `3DM ≤ X3C ≤ Decodes` is now formalized end to end.

  THE IMPORTED WALL (named, NOT proved — mathlib has no complexity framework):
    * the NP complexity class itself, and poly-time-ness of this reduction (it is visibly local —
      each triple maps to one 3-set — but "polynomial" is unformalized);
    * 3DM's OWN NP-hardness (Garey–Johnson problem GT2, via `3SAT ≤ 3DM`, NOT yet formalized — the
      next milestone; this file only relates 3DM to X3C, it does not prove 3DM hard from scratch);
    * the DEEP TERMINAL WALL = SAT's NP-hardness (Cook–Levin), a multi-year formalization, named
      forever as the ultimate source of every Karp-reduction hardness claim in this chain.
  STANDING LIMIT (unchanged): NP-hardness is CONDITIONAL on P≠NP — never absolute.  What this file
  adds is one Karp layer of REACH: it pushes the imported wall outward from "X3C is hard" to
  "3DM is hard", since `3DM ↔ X3C` (the reduction is an equivalence — `reduce3DM` is essentially a
  relabeling).  A small but composable, de-risking step toward the genuine gadget reduction
  `3SAT ≤ 3DM` that would discharge 3DM's hardness internally.

/-- **THE REDUCTION CORRECTNESS** (machine-checked, pure combinatorics).  `ThreeDM t` holds iff the
    reduced X3C instance `reduce3DM t` has an exact cover.  Both sides are `∃ T, <cond>`; for a
    fixed `T`, the X3C exact-cover condition `∀ u : W ⊕ X ⊕ Y, coverCount … u = 1` decomposes via
    `Sum.forall` (applied twice, for `W ⊕ (X ⊕ Y)`) into the three slots, and the cover-count
    lemmas rewrite each slot into the corresponding per-part matching count.  So the X3C condition
    is EXACTLY `ThreeDM`'s three-fold "covered once" condition — no gadgets, just the Sum
    bookkeeping. -/

    `ThreeDM t ↔ Decodes (reduce3DM t) q`.  The formalized hardness chain `3DM ≤ X3C ≤ Decodes`
    is now complete end to end; only the COMPLEXITY WRAPPING (NP class, poly-time-ness, 3DM's own

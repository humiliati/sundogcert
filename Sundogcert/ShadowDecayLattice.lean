# The characteristic-function decay is the sharp resist boundary: AC resists, lattice survives

`Sundogcert.ShadowDecayGeneral` proves the determine/resist law and shows that **RESIST** — the
averaged continuous fringe `cos(2π(c + λ x) t)` washes out as the spread `λ → ∞` — is governed by
the single spectral condition

  `‖charFun μ s‖ → 0`   as `s → ∞`   (`resistance_general`),

the **decay of the characteristic function** (the Rajchman / Riemann–Lebesgue condition). This file
shows that condition is the sharp dividing line between two clean families of populations:

* **ABSOLUTELY-CONTINUOUS populations resist.** Any `μ = volume.withDensity f` with `f` an
  integrable density has `‖charFun μ s‖ → 0` by the **Riemann–Lebesgue lemma**
  (`absCont_charFun_tendsto_zero`),
  so it resists (`absCont_resists`). This generalizes the Gaussian, uniform, and Cauchy examples
  (`ShadowDecayCauchy` is the heavy-tailed instance — infinite variance, yet still resists).

* **LATTICE / ATOMIC populations survive.** The symmetric two-point (Rademacher) measure
  `twoPoint a = ½(δ₋ₐ + δₐ)` has characteristic function `charFun = cos(a·)` (`twoPoint_charFun`),
  which **recurs to its supremum `1`** at `t = kπ/|a|` and therefore does NOT decay
  (`twoPoint_does_not_resist`). It fails the hypothesis of `resistance_general`, and concretely
  the averaged shadow `cos(2π c t)·cos(2π λ a t)` recurs to `cos(2π c t) ≠ 0` along `λ = k/(a t)`,
  so the continuous signal **SURVIVES** (`twoPoint_shadow_survives`).

The separation is **orthogonal to variance.** The Cauchy population has *infinite* variance yet
resists (`ShadowDecayCauchy.cauchy_resists`); the bounded two-point has *finite everything* yet
survives. What decides resistance is the charFun spectrum, not any moment.

## What is and is NOT claimed

* **IS proved (deductive, axiom-clean):**
  - `AC ⟹ resist`: one clean direction, via Riemann–Lebesgue (`absCont_resists`).
  - `lattice ⟹ survive`: the other clean direction, via the recurrence of `cos` (the two-point
    `charFun` does not decay, `twoPoint_does_not_resist`; the shadow recurs,
    `twoPoint_shadow_survives`).
  - The capstone `resist_separates_ac_from_lattice`: AC sits on the resist side of the
    `‖charFun‖ → 0` boundary, the two-point sits on the survive side — they bracket it.

## What is NOT claimed (the residual named wall)

We do **NOT** claim `resist ⟺ absolutely continuous`. That equivalence is **false**: there exist
*singular-continuous* **Rajchman** measures whose characteristic function decays (so they resist)
despite having no density at all. The honest, provable content is exactly the spectral framing of
`ShadowDecayGeneral` together with its two clean brackets:

  (i)  resist is governed by `‖charFun μ‖ → 0` (the Rajchman/spectral condition — the framing);
  (ii) AC `⟹` resist (Riemann–Lebesgue, proved here);
  (iii) lattice/atomic `⟹` survive (the recurrence of `cos`, proved here).

The **full Rajchman characterization** — precisely which singular measures have decaying
characteristic function — is subtle (it is not captured by absolute continuity, nor by any moment
condition) and is **not formalized**. AC and lattice are the two clean families that *bracket* the
boundary; the exact location of the boundary among singular measures is the named residual.

/-! ## CAPSTONE — the charFun-decay condition separates AC (resist) from lattice (survive). -/

/--
**THE SHARP BOUNDARY (capstone) — charFun decay separates AC from lattice.**

The resist condition of the general law is the spectral condition `‖charFun μ s‖ → 0`. This capstone
shows that condition is the sharp dividing line bracketed by the two clean families:

* an **absolutely-continuous** population `absContMeasure f` (`f` a nonnegative integrable density)
  **satisfies** the resist condition (`absCont_charFun_tendsto_zero`, by Riemann–Lebesgue), so it
  resists;
* the **lattice** population `twoPoint a` (`a ≠ 0`) **fails** the resist condition
  (`twoPoint_does_not_resist`, its characteristic function is `cos(a·)`, which recurs to `1`), so it
  survives.

AC sits on the resist side of the boundary, the two-point on the survive side — they bracket it.

**What is NOT claimed.** This is `AC ⟹ resist` and `lattice ⟹ survive`, NOT `resist ⟺ AC`. The
latter is false: singular-continuous **Rajchman** measures also resist (their characteristic
function decays
while they have no density). The full Rajchman characterization of which singular measures resist is
subtle and is not captured here — AC and lattice are the two clean *brackets*, not a complete
dichotomy. -/

**The separation is ORTHOGONAL to variance** (composed with `ShadowDecayCauchy`). What governs
resistance is the characteristic-function spectrum, NOT any moment:

* the **Cauchy** population has *infinite* variance — indeed no first moment at all
  (`ShadowDecayCauchy.cauchy_no_mean`) — yet it **resists**
  (`ShadowDecayCauchy.cauchy_charFun_tendsto_zero`), because it is absolutely continuous and its
  charFun decays;
* the bounded **two-point** population has *finite everything* yet **survives**
  (`twoPoint_does_not_resist`), because its charFun `cos(a·)` does not decay.

So resistance cannot be read off the variance: an infinite-variance law resists while a
bounded law survives. The deciding quantity is the charFun decay alone. -/

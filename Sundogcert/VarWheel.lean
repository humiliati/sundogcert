  Sundogcert/VarWheel.lean — MILESTONE 2 of the `3SAT ≤ 3DM` marathon.

  WHAT THIS FILE PROVIDES (the variable "wheel" / truth-setting gadget + its LOCAL CORRECTNESS):
    The Garey–Johnson truth-setting ring for a 3-CNF formula with `m` clauses.  For each
    `j : Fin m` the gadget owns two INTERNAL nodes `a j`, `b j` (covered exactly once, living only
    here) and two TIP nodes `posTip j`, `negTip j` (shared later with the clause gadgets).  The two
    cover triples are
        positive  t_j  = (posTip j, a j,       b j)
        negative  t⁻_j = (negTip j, a (j+1),   b j)      [index `j+1` CYCLIC in `Fin m`].
    Because `b j` lies ONLY in `{t_j, t⁻_j}`, any valid internal cover selects exactly one triple
    per `j` — i.e. is a `Selection σ : Fin m → Bool` (`σ j = true` picks `t_j`, `false` picks
    `t⁻_j`).  Node `a j` is touched by `t_j` (iff `σ j = true`) and by `t⁻_(j-1)` (iff
    `σ (j-1) = false`); "`a j` covered exactly once" is the EXCLUSIVE-OR of those two facts.

    THE ENGINE (`validCover_iff_const`): the ring has EXACTLY TWO valid internal covers — the
    all-true and all-false selections — the two truth values of the variable.  We also expose,
    per constant state, which tips are left FREE (raw, label-deferred): the true-state frees every
    `negTip` and the false-state frees every `posTip`.

  THE GADGET PICTURE (a ring; arrows are the two triples per spoke `j`, indices cyclic):

        a 0 ──t_0── b 0 ──t⁻_0── a 1 ──t_1── b 1 ──t⁻_1── a 2 ── … ── (wraps to a 0)
          posTip j attaches to t_j ;  negTip j attaches to t⁻_j .

  THE IMPORTED WALL (named, NOT proved — mathlib has no complexity framework):
    * the NP complexity class and poly-time-ness of the reduction;
    * 3SAT's OWN NP-hardness — Cook–Levin, the deep terminal wall sourcing every Karp-reduction
      hardness claim in this `3SAT ≤ 3DM ≤ X3C ≤ Decodes` chain.

  STANDING LIMIT: this module proves the wheel's LOCAL correctness only.  The clause gadget, the
  garbage-collection triples, and the global assembly onto `Sundog.MatchingNPHard.ThreeDM`
  (including the obligation that `b j` truly lies only in `{t_j, t⁻_j}`, which makes `σ`
  well-defined) are milestones 3–8.

  Decidability of `ValidCover` is registered explicitly (it is a `∀` over `Fin m` of a decidable
  `Prop`, but does not auto-resolve through the `def`).  This locks the two-cover claim at `m = 3`
  by kernel `decide` — AXIOM-CLEAN (no `Lean.ofReduceBool`; we use `decide`, never `native_decide`).

/-- The internal node `a j` is covered EXACTLY ONCE: exactly one of
    `σ j = true` (the positive triple `t_j` touches `a j`) and
    `σ (j-1) = false` (the negative triple `t⁻_(j-1)` touches `a j`) holds. -/

/-! ### Decidability.

    `aCoveredOnce` is decidable (it is an `Xor` of two decidable `Prop`s), but the `∀`-wrapper
    `ValidCover` does not auto-resolve through the `def`; we register both instances explicitly so
    `decide` fires at `m = 3` below. -/

  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (Xor _ _))

  inferInstanceAs (Decidable (∀ j : Fin m, aCoveredOnce σ j))

/-! ### The engine: local correctness.

    The wheel has EXACTLY TWO valid internal covers, the all-true and all-false selections. -/

    equals `σ 0`.  Proved by strong induction on `j.val` (the cyclic predecessor strictly

/-! ### Free-tip characterization (raw, per constant state).

    Truth-value LABELING is deferred to milestone 3; here we record, per constant state, which

/-! ### Concrete decide-lock at `m = 3` (kernel `decide`, axiom-clean — NOT `native_decide`).

    Mirrors `validCover_iff_const` at `m = 3`: the only two valid covers are the constants
    `![true,true,true]` and `![false,false,false]`. -/

example : ∀ σ : Fin 3 → Bool,
    ValidCover σ ↔ (σ = ![true, true, true]) ∨ (σ = ![false, false, false]) := by
  decide

/-! ### Axiom audit.

    Expect `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (or a subset) — NO `sorryAx`, and NO
    `Lean.ofReduceBool` (the latter would signal a `native_decide`, which we deliberately avoid). -/

# Lossy averaging — a continuous signal resists, a shared discrete label survives

A second worked example of the discipline in `Sundogcert.Certificate`: **machine-check a deductive
core, name the imported wall.** The certificate's lossiness is finite-field algebra (a parity-check
shadow loses a secret); this is its real-analysis sibling. A lossy *averaging* shadow **washes a
continuous variable** (a Gaussian / Debye–Waller decay) while **keeping a shared discrete label**
(exact, at every spread `λ`) — both halves of the dichotomy, proved.

## What is and is NOT formalized

* **IS formalized (deductive):** the Gaussian-averaging decay. If a population of units carries a
  continuous fringe signal `cos(2π c t)` and the frequency `c` is spread Gaussianly,
  `c_i = c⋆ + λ ξ_i` with `ξ ∼ N(0,1)`, then the ensemble-averaged shadow is
  `S(t) = cos(2π c⋆ t) · exp(-2π² λ² t²)`. The damping `exp(-2π² λ² t²)` is the **Debye–Waller**
  factor: `1` at `λ = 0` (no loss, `c⋆` recoverable), tending to `0` as `λ → ∞` for any probe
  `t ≠ 0` (the continuous signal is washed out — it RESISTS recovery from the averaged shadow).

* **NOT formalized (the imported wall):** that a *real* system instantiates this structure — a
  genuine population with an honest lossiness knob `λ` — is a modeling assumption, not a theorem.
  It is the analogue of the certificate's imported hardness: the mechanism is proved; that the world
  realizes it is named, not proved.

* **ALSO formalized (the determination half):** a shared discrete label carried identically by every
  unit survives the same averaging EXACTLY, at every spread `λ` (`determination`) — the per-unit
  zero-mean noise averages out. Lossy averaging keeps the discrete and washes the continuous.

## The one imported analytic input

The CORE (`gaussianCos_integral`) is **PROVED from mathlib**, not assumed: it is the real part
of the standard-normal characteristic function `charFun (gaussianReal 0 1) s = exp(-s²/2)`
(`ProbabilityTheory.charFun_gaussianReal`). Everything else is elementary algebra plus one limit;
there are no axioms beyond mathlib's.

**CORE (make-or-break) — the Gaussian characteristic function, real part.**

The standard-normal expectation of `cos (s ξ)` equals `exp(-s² / 2)`:

This is the real part of the standard-normal characteristic function

**The sin signature averages to zero** (odd-function / imaginary-part companion of the CORE).

`∫ x, sin (s x) ∂N(0,1) = 0`. It is the imaginary part of the standard-normal characteristic
function `exp(-s²/2)`, whose argument is real, so the imaginary part vanishes. This is the term that
drops out of `cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B` after averaging. -/

**DEBYE_WALLER — the ensemble-averaged continuous signature.**

Averaging the continuous fringe `cos (2π (c + λ ξ) t)` over the standard-normal population spread
`ξ ∼ N(0,1)` factors into the undamped signature times the Debye–Waller damping:
`∫ x, cos (2π (c + λ x) t) ∂N(0,1) = cos (2π c t) · exp(-2π² λ² t²)`.

Derivation: with `A = 2π c t` and `s = 2π λ t`, `cos (A + s x) = cos A cos (s x) - sin A sin (s x)`.
The `cos (s x)` term averages to `exp(-s²/2) = exp(-2π² λ² t²)` (the CORE) and the `sin (s x)` term
averages to `0` (`gaussianSin_integral`). -/

**RESISTANCE — the continuous signature is washed out as the spread grows.**

For any fixed nonzero probe `t`, the Debye–Waller amplitude vanishes as the population spread
`λ → ∞`: `Tendsto (fun λ => exp(-2π² λ² t²)) atTop (𝓝 0)`. As the lossy averaging widens, the
continuous fringe amplitude → 0 — the continuous hidden variable becomes unrecoverable from the
averaged shadow. -/

**LOSSINESS_ESSENTIAL — without loss, nothing is suppressed.**

At zero spread `λ = 0` the Debye–Waller damping is `exp(0) = 1` (undamped) for every probe `t`: an
un-averaged (injective) shadow loses nothing, so the continuous signature is fully recoverable. It
is precisely the lossiness `λ > 0` that produces the resistance of `resistance`. -/

A label `d` carried *identically* by every unit (a shared sign / class, not per-unit noise) is
recovered exactly by the ensemble average: `∫ x, (d + λ c x) ∂N(0,1) = d`, because the per-unit
zero-mean noise `λ c ξ` averages out (`gaussian_mean_zero`). Unlike the continuous Debye–Waller
decay of `resistance`, this is INDEPENDENT of `λ`: the shared label is never washed out — it is
determined at every population spread. -/

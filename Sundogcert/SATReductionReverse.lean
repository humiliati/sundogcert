  Sundogcert/SATReductionReverse.lean — MILESTONE 7 of the `3SAT ≤ 3DM` marathon: the REVERSE
  DIRECTION of the reduction's correctness.

  WHAT THIS FILE PROVES (`reverse`):
      `ThreeDM_I (tripleFn φ) → Satisfiable φ`
  — a perfect 3-dimensional matching of the gadget triple map yields a satisfying assignment for
  the formula `φ`.  This is the analytic crux of the reduction; it does NOT touch the garbage
  triples (their only role is to absorb the unused tips, which a perfect matching handles for free).

  THE PROOF IDEA (pure combinatorics):
    Let `T : Finset (TripleIdx n m)` be the matching selection.
    * Define `σ i j := decide (posT i j ∈ T)` — for each variable `i`, the wheel state read off
      from which positive triples were selected.
    * Each b-node `(i,j)` is covered exactly once (`hY`); the only triples touching it are
      `posT i j` and `negT i j` (incidence `ycoord_inl`).  So EXACTLY ONE of the two is in `T`:
      `posT i j ∈ T ↔ ¬ negT i j ∈ T`  (the helper `card_filter_pair_eq_one`).
    * Each a-node `(i,j)` is covered exactly once (`hX`); the only triples touching it are
      `posT i j` and `negT i (j-1)` (incidence `xcoord_inl`, the CYCLIC spoke shift).  So
      `posT i j ∈ T ↔ ¬ negT i (j-1) ∈ T`.
    * Chaining the two facts forces `σ i j = σ i (j-1)` for every spoke ⟹ `σ i` is a `ValidCover`
      ⟹ by `validCover_iff_const`, `σ i` is CONSTANT (the wheel admits only the all-true / all-false
      covers — the two truth values).  Take the assignment `a i := !(σ i 0)`.
    * Each s1-node `k` is covered exactly once (`hX`), and the only triples touching it are the
      clause-`k` slot triples (`xcoord_s1`).  Hence some `clauseT k slotStar ∈ T`; its W-tip
      `τ = (iS, k, sgn)` (with `(iS, sgn) = φ k slotStar`) is then covered by that clause triple, so
      the matching wheel triple over `τ` (`posT iS k` if `sgn`, else `negT iS k`) is NOT in `T`
      (`hW`: the W-fibre over `τ` has card 1).  Reading this back through `σ` shows the literal
      `φ k slotStar` evaluates to `true`, hence clause `k` is satisfied.

  STANDING LIMIT: this module proves ONLY the reverse direction.  The forward direction
  (`Satisfiable φ → ThreeDM_I (tripleFn φ)` — a matching from an assignment) is milestone 8.

  NOTE on the `synthInstance.maxSize` bump: `DecidableEq (TripleIdx n m)` (a 4-way nested `Sum` of
  products) does not synthesize at the default `maxSize`; the `filter_congr` rewrites whose target
  predicate is `idx = posT i j ∨ idx = negT i j` push the threshold higher still.  A scoped
  `set_option synthInstance.maxSize 512 in` on `reverse` clears it (the generic helper needs none).

  Axiom-clean (no `native_decide`; the only `decide` is the data-level Prop-membership read).
  Expect `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` on both `reverse` and the helper.

/-- In a `Finset` `T`, if exactly one of two DISTINCT elements `a`, `b` is present (the `{a,b}`
    fibre of `T` has card `1`), then membership of `a` is the negation of membership of `b`. -/

/-- **Reverse correctness.**  A perfect 3-dimensional matching of the gadget triple map yields a
    satisfying assignment: the wheel triples force each variable's selection constant (a truth
    value), and each clause's selected slot triple frees its literal's wheel triple, making the
    literal true.  (One direction only; the forward direction is milestone 8.) -/

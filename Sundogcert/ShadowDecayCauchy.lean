# The Cauchy population is the determine/resist separator

`Sundogcert.ShadowDecayGeneral` proves the general averaging law and splits the determine/resist
dichotomy into **two independent spectral conditions** of the averaging measure `μ`:

* RESIST — the continuous fringe washes out — is governed by **decay of the characteristic
  function** `‖charFun μ s‖ → 0` (the Riemann–Lebesgue property), discharged by
  `resistance_general`.
* DETERMINE — a shared discrete label survives — is governed by a **finite centered mean**
  `Integrable id μ ∧ ∫ x ∂μ = 0`, discharged by `determination_general`.

That module *names* the **standard Cauchy law** as the motivating witness that these two conditions
genuinely come apart — Cauchy *resists* (its characteristic function decays) yet *cannot determine*
(it has no first moment) — but leaves the Cauchy instance as future work, because mathlib's
`ProbabilityTheory.cauchyMeasure` ships with neither its characteristic-function decay nor the
non-integrability of its mean.

This module **builds that instance**, turning the named separator into a proved theorem.

## What is formalized here (deductive, axiom-clean)

* **RESIST (`cauchy_charFun_tendsto_zero`, `cauchy_resists`).** The Cauchy density `cauchyPDFReal`
  is `L¹` (it is a probability density), so its characteristic function is the Fourier transform of
  an integrable function and `‖charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s‖ → 0` as `s → ∞` by the
  **Riemann–Lebesgue lemma** (`Real.zero_at_infty_fourier`). Feeding this to `resistance_general`
  shows the Cauchy-averaged continuous signature washes out as the spread `λ → ∞`.

* **NO-MEAN (`cauchy_no_mean`).** `¬ Integrable id (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ)` for `γ ≠ 0`: the first
  moment diverges. Reduced (via `integrable_withDensity_iff_integrable_smul'`) to the
  non-integrability of `x ↦ cauchyPDFReal x₀ γ x * x` on `volume`, which is shown by a tail
  comparison: on a half-line `(a, ∞)` the integrand dominates a constant multiple of `x⁻¹`, and
  `x⁻¹` is not integrable on any `(a, ∞)` (`not_integrableOn_Ioi_inv`). So the `Integrable id μ`
  hypothesis of `determination_general` **fails** for Cauchy.

* **SEPARATOR (`cauchy_is_separator`).** Combining the two halves: a standard Cauchy population
  satisfies the resist condition `‖charFun μ‖ → 0` yet fails the determination hypothesis
  `Integrable id μ`. So `resist` and `determine` provably come apart — they are two different facts
  about the averaging population, exactly as the general law states.

## What is NOT formalized (the residual named wall)

The **exact** value `charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s = exp(-γ|s|)` (the Poisson kernel) is *not*
proved — only its decay, which is all the separator needs. The exact characteristic function is a
from-scratch contour / residue computation (mathlib has the Poisson kernel in
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Poisson` but no `charFun_cauchy`); it remains a candidate mathlib upstream
and the one residual named wall of this module. The honesty is the same as `ShadowDecay`: the
deductive separator is proved; the sharper exact-value statement is named, not asserted.

**The Cauchy characteristic function as a Fourier integral.** For scale `γ ≠ 0`, the
characteristic function of the Cauchy measure is the Fourier transform of its `L¹` density, sampled
at `-s / (2π)`: `charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s = 𝓕 (fun x => (cauchyPDFReal x₀ γ x : ℂ)) (-s/2π)`.

This is the bridge that lets the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma act on `charFun`: it rewrites the integral
against the measure as an integral against `volume` weighted by the real density
(`integral_withDensity_eq_integral_toReal_smul₀`) and matches the `exp(s x I)` phase to the Fourier
kernel `𝐞(-(x w))` with `w = -s/(2π)`. -/

**RESIST (the Cauchy charFun decays).** `‖charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s‖ → 0` as `s → ∞`.

The Cauchy density is integrable (`integrable_cauchyPDFReal`), so its Fourier transform vanishes at
infinity by the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma (`Real.zero_at_infty_fourier`). The sampling point
`-s / (2π)` runs off to `-∞` as `s → ∞`, which lies in the `cocompact ℝ` filter, so composing gives
the `atTop` decay. This is the resist condition of the general law, with **no variance assumed** —
the Cauchy variance is infinite, yet it resists. -/

**RESIST applied — the Cauchy-averaged continuous signature washes out.** Feeding the Cauchy charFun
decay to `resistance_general`: for any forward probe `t > 0`, the ensemble average of the continuous
fringe `cos(2π(c + λ x) t)` over a Cauchy population `x ∼ cauchyMeasure x₀ γ` tends to `0` as the
spread `λ → ∞`. The continuous hidden variable becomes unrecoverable — Cauchy resists. -/

**The weighted density is not integrable.** `¬ Integrable (fun x => cauchyPDFReal x₀ γ x * x)`
against `volume`, for `γ ≠ 0`. This is the analytic heart of the no-mean fact.

On the half-line `(a, ∞)` with `a = |x₀| + γ + 1`, the integrand dominates `(γ/(5π)) · x⁻¹`:
indeed `(x - x₀)² + γ² ≤ 5x²` there, so
`cauchyPDFReal x₀ γ x · x = π⁻¹ γ x / ((x-x₀)²+γ²) ≥ (γ/(5π)) x⁻¹`. Since `x⁻¹` is not integrable on
any half-line (`not_integrableOn_Ioi_inv`), neither is the integrand. -/

**THE SEPARATOR (capstone).** For any standard Cauchy population (`γ ≠ 0`), the resist condition of
the general law holds — `‖charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s‖ → 0` — while the determination
hypothesis fails — `¬ Integrable id (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ)`.

So the two conditions of `ShadowDecayGeneral` are **logically independent**: a population can
satisfy the charFun-decay (resist) condition and still fail the finite-mean (determine) condition.
The Cauchy law is the witness that `resist` and `determine` come apart — they are two different
spectral facts about the averaging measure, not one. (Contrast `gaussian_resist_and_determine`,
where the Gaussian discharges **both**.) -/

# Halo minimum-deviation geometry (textbook geometric optics)

A standalone, machine-checked formalization of the **minimum-deviation principle**
for a ray of light passing through an ice prism — the geometry behind the 22-degree
atmospheric halo (Greenler 1980, Tape 1994; fully public, textbook material).

## What is PROVED here (the deductive core)

For a prism of apex angle `A` and refractive index `n`, with Snell's law
`sin θᵢ = n · sin rᵢ` holding at each face and the two refraction angles summing to
the apex (`r₂ = A − r₁`), the total angular deviation of the ray is

  `dev n A r = arcsin (n · sin r) + arcsin (n · sin (A − r)) − A`.

We prove:

* `dev_value` — at the symmetric ray `r = A/2` the deviation equals
  `2 · arcsin (n · sin (A/2)) − A` (because `sin (A − A/2) = sin (A/2)`).
* `min_deviation_stationary` (THE CORE) — the deviation is **stationary** at the
  symmetric ray: `HasDerivAt (dev n A) 0 (A/2)`.  The proof is the clean symmetry
  argument: writing `g r = arcsin (n · sin r)`, we have `dev r = g r + g (A − r) − A`,
  so `dev' r = g' r − g' (A − r)`; at `r = A/2` both arguments coincide and the two
  derivative terms cancel.  No explicit value of `g'` is ever needed.
* `min_deviation_isLocalMin` (THE UPGRADE) — the symmetric ray is a genuine
  **local minimum** of the deviation, proved unconditionally from the geometry.
  The second derivative `dev''(A/2) = 2·g''(A/2)` is computed and shown to be
  strictly positive whenever `n > 1`, `sin (A/2) > 0`, and the ray refracts out
  (no total internal reflection).  This is exactly *why* the deviation bottoms out
  at the symmetric ray, and hence why the halo appears as a bright ring at the
  minimum-deviation angle.  The supporting facts are `Dg_hasDerivAt` (the
  derivative of the first-derivative function) and `secondDeriv_sym_pos`
  (`dev''(A/2) > 0`).
* `symmetric_ray_isLocalMin_of_secondDeriv` — the original conditional wrapper of
  the textbook second-derivative test (kept as a now-superseded helper): IF the
  deviation is convex at the symmetric ray (positive second derivative), THEN that
  stationary ray is a genuine local minimum.  `min_deviation_isLocalMin` discharges
  that convexity hypothesis from the geometry, so it no longer needs to be assumed.

## The IMPORTED WALL (named, NOT proved here)

The pure geometry above is what this module certifies.  The following are physical /
observational facts taken as given, NOT derived:

* that atmospheric ice crystals present **hexagonal 60-degree prism** geometry
  (apex `A = π/3`);
* the refractive index of ice `n ≈ 1.31` (empirical measurement);
* that light obeys **Snell's law** at each crystal face;
* that the ray actually **refracts out** of the second face — i.e. there is no total
  internal reflection.  This is exactly the hypothesis `-1 < n · sin r` and
  `n · sin r < 1` that `arcsin` differentiability requires, and we carry it as an
  explicit hypothesis rather than asserting it;
* that the **observed bright ring** of the halo forms at the deviation extremum
  (the ray pile-up where deviation is stationary — an observational/optical fact).

The method proves the geometry of minimum deviation.  That the sky *realizes* this
geometry as a visible halo is named, not proved.

/-- **Minimum-deviation principle (THE DEDUCTIVE CORE).**

The angular deviation `dev n A` is **stationary at the symmetric ray** `r = A/2`:
its derivative there is `0`.

Hypotheses (the imported optical wall, named explicitly): the ray refracts out at
the symmetric ray, i.e. `n · sin (A/2) ≠ ±1` (no total internal reflection), so the
`arcsin` is differentiable there.

The proof is pure symmetry: `dev r = g r + g (A − r) − A` with `g = faceDev n`.
The first term contributes `Dg`, the reflected term `g (A − ·)` contributes `−Dg`
(chain rule, inner derivative `−1`), and at `r = A/2` both `Dg`'s are evaluated at
the SAME point `A/2`, so they cancel: `Dg + (−Dg) = 0`. -/

/-- **The symmetric ray is the minimum-deviation ray (THE UPGRADE).**
The stationary symmetric ray `r = A/2` is a genuine **local minimum** of the
deviation, proved *unconditionally* from the geometry: the second derivative is
`dev''(A/2) = 2·g''(A/2) > 0` (`secondDeriv_sym_pos`), the first derivative vanishes
(`min_deviation_stationary`), and the deviation is continuous there.  Feeding all
three to the textbook second-derivative test gives the local minimum.

This is the formal "minimum deviation" statement: among rays through the prism, the
symmetric one deviates least, and that is why the halo is seen as a bright ring at
the minimum-deviation angle.  Hypotheses are the named optical wall only: `n > 1`
(denser ice), `sin (A/2) > 0` (`A/2 ∈ (0, π/2)`, real prism apex), and the ray
refracts out at the symmetric face (`−1 < n·sin (A/2) < 1`, no total internal

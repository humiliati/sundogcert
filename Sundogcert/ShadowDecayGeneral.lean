# The determine/resist dichotomy is the characteristic-function spectrum of the averaging kernel

`Sundogcert.ShadowDecay` proves the lossy-averaging dichotomy for ONE population — the standard
Gaussian. This file extracts the **general law** behind it and shows the two halves are governed by
**two different spectral conditions** of the averaging measure `μ`, not one.

Averaging the continuous fringe `cos(2π(c + λ x) t)` over an arbitrary population `x ∼ μ` factors,
for EVERY probability measure `μ`, through `μ`'s **characteristic function** `charFun μ`:

  `∫ cos(2π(c + λ x) t) ∂μ = Re[ exp(2π i c t) · charFun μ (2π λ t) ]`     (`shadow_decay_charFun`)

The Gaussian's Debye–Waller damping `exp(-2π²λ²t²)` is just `Re charFun` for `μ = N(0,1)`; the law
holds for any `μ`. From this single identity the dichotomy splits into **independent** conditions:

* **RESIST** (the continuous signal washes out): governed by **decay of `‖charFun μ‖`**. If
  `‖charFun μ s‖ → 0` as `s → ∞` (the Riemann–Lebesgue property — true of every
  absolutely-continuous population: Gaussian, uniform, AND the heavy-tailed **Cauchy**, whose
  variance is infinite), then the averaged shadow `→ 0` as `λ → ∞` (`resistance_general`).
  Resistance is a property of the charFun SPECTRUM, not of the variance.

* **DETERMINE** (a shared discrete label survives): governed by a **finite centered mean**
  `∫ x ∂μ = 0` with `x` integrable (`determination_general`). This is a SEPARATE condition: it asks
  for a first moment, which `‖charFun‖ → 0` neither implies nor is implied by.

**The separation made concrete (the Cauchy witness).** A standard Cauchy population *resists*
(`charFun = exp(-|s|) → 0`, a Poisson kernel) yet *cannot determine* (it has no mean — its sample
average is itself Cauchy and never concentrates). So `resist` and `determine` come apart: they are
two different facts about `μ`, as a population-swap experiment confirms numerically (Gaussian /
uniform / Cauchy wash; a lattice population whose `charFun = cos` does not).

## What is and is NOT formalized here

* **IS formalized (deductive):** the general identity `shadow_decay_charFun`; the resist corollary
  from the *named* hypothesis `‖charFun μ‖ → 0`; the determine corollary from the *named* hypotheses
  `Integrable id μ ∧ ∫ x ∂μ = 0`; and the proof that the **Gaussian discharges both** (so the
  `ShadowDecay` results are recovered as the `μ = N(0,1)` instance).

* **Proved in sibling pillars (built after this file):** the **Cauchy separator** is now a theorem
  in `Sundogcert.ShadowDecayCauchy` — it discharges the resist hypothesis by Riemann–Lebesgue
  (`cauchy_charFun_tendsto_zero`) and *refutes* the determine hypothesis by a tail comparison with
  `x⁻¹` (`cauchy_no_mean`), giving `cauchy_is_separator : resist ∧ ¬ Integrable id`. The clean
  AC-resist / lattice-survive brackets of the `‖charFun‖ → 0` boundary are in
  `Sundogcert.ShadowDecayLattice`. So the separator the Cauchy witness names is no longer
  empirical-only — it is machine-checked and axiom-clean (build-enforced in `AxiomAudit`).

* **The one residual named wall:** the **exact** Cauchy characteristic function
  `charFun (cauchyMeasure x₀ γ) s = exp(-γ|s|)` (the Poisson kernel) is still *not* proved — only
  its *decay*, which is all the resist condition needs. mathlib has the Poisson kernel in
  `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Poisson` but no `charFun_cauchy` lemma; the exact value remains a
  candidate mathlib-upstream. Same honesty as `ShadowDecay`'s imported wall: the mechanism and the
  separator are proved; only the sharper exact-value statement is named.

**The general averaging law (cos/sin form).** For ANY probability measure `μ`, the ensemble-averaged
continuous signature factors through the characteristic function of the averaging population:
`∫ cos(2π(c + λ x) t) ∂μ = cos(2π c t)·Re[charFun μ (2π λ t)] − sin(2π c t)·Im[charFun μ (2π λ t)]`.

Derivation: with `A = 2π c t`, `s = 2π λ t`, expand `cos(A + s x) = cos A cos(s x) − sin A sin(s x)`
and average; `∫ cos(s x) = Re charFun`, `∫ sin(s x) = Im charFun` (`integral_cos/sin_charFun`). -/

/-! ## RESIST — governed by decay of `‖charFun μ‖` (Riemann–Lebesgue), not by variance. -/

/--
**RESISTANCE (general).** If the averaging population's characteristic function decays,
`‖charFun μ s‖ → 0` as `s → ∞` (the Riemann–Lebesgue property of any absolutely-continuous `μ`),
then for any fixed forward probe `t > 0` the averaged continuous signature washes out as the spread
grows: `∫ cos(2π(c + λ x) t) ∂μ → 0` as `λ → ∞`. The bound is `|shadow| ≤ ‖charFun μ (2π λ t)‖`
(the phasor has unit modulus), so resistance is exactly the charFun decay, independent of moments.

first but not the second, witnessing that neither implies the other. -/

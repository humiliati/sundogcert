  Sundogcert/CertWall.lean — TYPING the imported hardness wall as a CONDITIONAL theorem.

  The prose the certificate ships with says:

    "a cheap, basis-robust, TIGHT reject bound would be a fast decoder, so the
     basis-dependence of `colWeightLb` is the visible edge of the imported hardness."

  This module turns that PROSE into TYPED Lean.  It does NOT prove decoding hardness,
  P≠NP, or one-wayness — those stay an IMPORTED assumption (ISD/SIS), named honestly.
  What is proved here is the WALL's SHAPE:

    (1) `minCosetWeight H z` = the true semantic quantity the verifier lower-bounds: the
        minimum Hamming weight over the syndrome coset `{ e' | H e' = z }`.  Computing it
        WITH a witness IS decoding (the imported-hard FIND problem); the verifier only ever
        holds a cheap SOUND lower bound on it.

    (2) CODE-INVARIANCE (`minCosetWeight_rowEquiv`): `minCosetWeight` depends only on the
        CODE (`ker H`), not the BASIS `H`.  Left-multiplying `H` by an invertible `M` (a
        row-operation / change of parity-check basis) leaves `minCosetWeight` unchanged on
        corresponding syndromes.  REAL content — a genuine coset bijection.

    (3) BASIS-DEPENDENCE of `colWeightLb` (`colWeightLb_not_basis_invariant`): the cheap sound
        bound is NOT a code invariant.  On the dense row-equivalent `H` of the SAME code it
        collapses to `0` while the true `minCosetWeight` stays `≥ m`.  Instantiates Looseness's
        `looseness`/`safe_dense_iff_proj` (a concrete, witnessed counterexample).

    (4) THE TYPED WALL (`tight_bound_decodes`, CONDITIONAL): IF a verifier's bound `lb` is tight
        on a body's syndrome (`lb z = minCosetWeight z`) THEN evaluating that cheap bound there
        COMPUTES the decoding distance.  HONEST: the antecedent "tight on this code" IS the
        decoding answer — the theorem TYPES that equivalence, it does NOT discharge it.  With
        (2)+(3): a bound tight on EVERY basis would be a code invariant (2), yet `colWeightLb`
        provably is not (3); so "cheap + basis-robust + tight" is exactly the imported-hard
        decoder, which `colWeightLb` (and the cheap bounds here) do NOT achieve.

  HONESTY LEDGER.  (1) is definitional ground truth.  (2) is a non-trivial invariance (the
  invertible-`M` coset bijection).  (3) is a concrete refutation with witnessed schemes
  (`projScheme` vs `denseScheme`).  (4) is deliberately a CONDITIONAL whose hypothesis IS the
  decoding assumption, so it makes NO unconditional hardness claim.  The synthesis
  (`colWeightLb_cannot_be_tight_basisRobust`) is a CONSEQUENCE of (2)+(3) stated about
  `colWeightLb` only — never a claim about the hardness of decoding itself.

    Left-multiplying `H` by an invertible `M` is a change of parity-check basis (a row
    operation): the kernel/code is unchanged, the cosets are in bijection, so the minimum coset
    weight is unchanged on corresponding syndromes.  No cross-`Scheme` transport needed. -/

/-! ### (4) THE TYPED WALL — a CONDITIONAL, not a hardness proof. -/

/-- A bound `lb` is **TIGHT at `z`** for parity-check `H` when it equals the true minimum coset

/-- **THE TYPED WALL (conditional).**  IF a verifier's bound is tight on a body's syndrome, THEN
    evaluating that cheap bound there EQUALS the decoding distance `minCosetWeight` — i.e. the
    cheap evaluation decides the imported-hard decoding question.  This is the HONEST typing of
    "a cheap, basis-robust, tight bound is a decoder": the conclusion is decoding, reached ONLY
    under the tightness HYPOTHESIS; nothing here discharges that hypothesis, so NO
    hardness/P≠NP/one-wayness claim is made. -/

/-- **SYNTHESIS (consequence of (2)+(3), about `colWeightLb` only).**  `colWeightLb` cannot be
    tight on every basis of a code: it is tight on the sparse projection (`= m = minCosetWeight`)
    but on the dense row-equivalent basis of the SAME code it is `0 ≠ minCosetWeight` (which is
    `≥ m`).  So `colWeightLb` is NOT a basis-robust tight bound — exactly the gap the imported
    hardness lives in.  (No claim that NO cheap bound could be tight everywhere — that WOULD be a
    decoder, which stays an imported assumption.) -/
